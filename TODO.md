- Audit all existing configs to apply overrides, files, and all sorts of nuance.
  - remove the npm WARNings
- add the rule count to the tag "around 1000 rules:
- Once audit is complete, open up all out-of-scope configs.
- Add commit linting in similar fashion
  - Stories:
    - I install this config, I get full commit linting with it.
  - Lint all rules on staged files, when the rest of the repo has no rules active.
- Add all the VUE configs.
- Programmatic API for conflicts.
  - Might not be feasible because of multiple conflicts
  - Might not be worth it because some configs will literally never be usurped, aka prettier
  - Would then be worth adding a bunch of rejected configs/plugins
